				<h3>Poker / Life Tip #5:</h3>

				<p>In poker, just like in the real world, you can be giving 100% and still not achieve success. In both worlds this can equate to monetary losses as well as a hit to your ego and confidence.</p> 
				<p>In poker, you can play hands perfectly and still lose money. It truly is gambling when it comes down to it. The way live poker differs from other casino games is:</p>
				<p class="list"><span>1) It is the only game where you play against other people.</span> Every other game in the casino, including video poker, you are playing against the house. And these casino odds will always beat you in the long run. I never play anything but live poker when I'm in a casino, because unless you can count cards at blackjack, which will get you kicked out, you will lose in the long run.</p> 
				<p class="list"><span>2) Poker is the only game in which you can influence the outcome of the hand once your chips are in the middle.</span> Every other game you put your chips in, roll the dice, spin the wheel, spin the slot, etc. and you either win or lose. It is more complicated than that in live poker. Cards come out, and you can bet more, try to get people to fold when you have nothing, or get them to put more chips in when you have a good hand!</p>
				<p> But back to my tip now. In the real world, for people such as musicians, artists, business owners, you may do everything right but something just isn't there to make your dreams come true. Whether it's not being in the right place at the right time, choosing the wrong location, or not meeting the right person to get you to the next level, there are so many little things that can affect success.</p>
				<p>And just like having crappy luck for weeks on end at the poker table, there's monetary loss and stress, and it starts to wear on you. You begin to question your ability, your confidence and ego are bruised, and you wonder if you're even good at what you do (even if you truly believe you are).</p>
				<p>This profession I choose, just like that of so many self-employed people, can really be draining at times, and it's not all glory and winning millions like televised poker shows make it out to be.</p> 
				<p>I give props to all the people who have a dream and are chasing it down despite the ups and downs. I understand how tough it is. And a big shout out to my fellow poker pros who have had losing weeks, months, and years even, then wake up the next day feeling like you're going to kick some ass.</p> 
				<p>It's not easy. I know. But keep trying harder and harder everyday as if you've experienced no hardships at all.</p> 
				<h3>Further Reading</h3>
				<p>I'm going to finish this week's poker / life tip with a great article on how much long losing streaks at the poker tables can affect your life away from the table. It is amazingly accurate and take note that the author wrote this article when he was on a big winning streak.</p>
